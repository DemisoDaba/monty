## Alx-project --> (0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO)

### Project Description: 
- Within this undertaking, I developed a straightforward interpreter designed for Monty ByteCodes. The interpreter is capable of parsing bytecode files and executing the instructions encoded within them.

### The Monty languages
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that shares a similar compilation process with Python, where it is initially converted into Monty byte codes. It operates on a distinctive stack structure and provides specialized instructions for manipulating this stack.

### Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes commonly utilize the .m extension, which has become a standard practice in the industry. However, it is important to note that this extension is not mandated by the language specification. Each line in a Monty byte code file consists of a single instruction. The opcode and its corresponding argument may be separated by any number of spaces, both before and after the opcode. For further clarification and illustrative examples, please refer to the examples section.
